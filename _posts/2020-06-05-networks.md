A Beginner's Guide To What It Is, How To Implement It, and Why It Matters

## Things to Know Before Reading

Just to be transparent with what this tutorial aims to accomplish, this is by no means a comprehensive tutorial over networks. This tutorial aims to introduce to beginners the concept of networks, some important and common terminology, as well as some code to get you started with the proper directions to explore the vast world of networks on your own. Each of the sections below have a text and code toggle for you to examine the code used to make these simple network graphs. The Python library used here is `networkx` [(documentation can be found here)](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/). D3.js is also a popular language for making beautiful and dynamic network graphs (and visualizations in general) but can be slightly trickier to learn. Enjoy the tutorial and stick around at the end for further recommended resources!

## Nodes

#### Technical Description
A node (or vertex) is the most fundamental unit on which graphs are based. In graph theory, they may also be referred to as "point", "junction", or "0 - simplex".

#### Real-World Relevance
This single datapoint could be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. If you were to consider a network of the human race, each node would be a person. For the network of webpages on the world wide web, each node would be a webpage. A node could also represent a single train station in a somewhat complex railway network. It is important to note that while we typically consider a node to be the fundamental unit of graphs, each node itself could contain a lot of information. In a social network, where each node represents a person, each node is a user profile comprised of data about the user's gender, age, contact information, their preferences, and other information they have made public.

## Edges

#### Technical Description
The links with which two nodes are connected to each other are called edges. In this case, for example, there are 3 nodes and 2 edges (one connects Node 1 and Node 2, and the other connects Node 2 and Node 3). The nodes that an edge connects are called neighbors. Note that Node 1 and Node 3 aren't neighbors with each other here. Broadly, we can have either undirected or directed graphs based on the context. In directed graphs (to the right), a node connects to another with a directed edge, indicating an asymmetric relationship.

In the case of undirected graphs (to the right), an undirected edge implies a symmetric relationship between the two nodes it connects.

#### Real-World Relevance
An edge implies a relationship between the two entities, which are repsented by nodes. In a social network, for example, an edge could imply a connection between two people. The nuance of directed and undirected graphs gives us a convenient way to represent more complex information. For example, a directed graph would be more fitting if we were to represent a genealogy network - we can then direct edges from ancestors to their successors (since it is somewhat an asymmetric relationship). Even a social network, which you would typically represent as an undirected graph, could be represented as a directed graph if you were to consider who sent whom the friend/follow request first - this would add another interesting dimension to the problem.

## Paths, Cycles, Connectivity

## Technical Description

![Picture of a path of nodes](/images/2020-06-05-networks/DirectEdge.png)

**Path:** A path is a sequence of nodes where "each consecutive pair in the sequence is connected with an edge" (Easley and Kleinberg, 2010). Broadly, if a path does not repeat any nodes, it is called a simple path. If it doesn't repeat any nodes, it is a non-simple path. In graph theory, a path is a trail in which all vertices (and edges) are distinct. In our example, there is a clear path from 1 to 3, and from 3 to 1 (via 2).

![Picture of a cycle of nodes](/images/2020-06-05-networks/Cycle.png)

**Cycle:** A cycle is a non-simple path with "at-least three edges, in which the first and last nodes are the same, but otherwise all nodes are distinct" (Easley and Kleinberg, 2010). A cycle graph is a graph of a cycle which has no repeated vertices and edges (a simple cycle). The given visualization is an example of a cycle graph.

![Picture of a DAG](/images/2020-06-05-networks/DAG.png)

A commonly-used concept is that of a **Directed Acyclical Graph (DAG)**, which is what the name implies - a graph that is acyclical in nature (does not have the same first and last nodes) and has directed edges. The given visualization represents a simple DAG with four nodes (1, 2, 3, 4). Connectivity: A graph is said to be connected "if for every pair of nodes, there is a path between them" (Easley and Kleinberg, 2010). In other words, there is a way to get from each node to each other node (regardless of how simple or complex that route may be).

#### Real-World Relevance
Paths and connectivity could be understood together. If we wanted to see if two nodes are connected, we could check if there exists a path between them. Consider the case of a police chasing a criminal on the run - traditionally, they would not be connected with the criminal and their job is to find a path (the shortest, most efficient one) to the criminal. They would conduct an investigation, find who are closest to the criminal (the end node), and trace back connections to one they could directly inquire. As soon as they find a link with the criminal, they are then connected to the criminal in the sense of a network, and can pursue the path. In short, unless they are connected to the end node, they do not have a viable path to pursue. Directed acylical graphs are also easy to understand in context of your daily lives. For example, consider what you have done today - likely, you brushed your teeth after you woke up, after which you probably (hopefully) had breakfast. This can be represented as a DAG, since each subsequent event (or node) has a dependency on the previous one. You can only brush your teeth after you woke up, and so you would draw a directed edge from "waking up" to "brushing teeth".
